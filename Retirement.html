                When nearing a retirement period, either by choice or through an employer’s decision,
                several questions should come to mind:<br>
            <h2>Have you saved enough?</h2>
            Unfortunately for most people saving for retirement tends to be like that orphaned child
            and gets overlooked and sacrificed,
            for what is considered to be ‘more important’ until it is too late to be able to save enough.
            Saving for retirement often presents a dilemma for most people – whether to secure your future
            or afford a better education for your kids or your parent’s medical bills. The presence of the
            Pandemic has worsened this situation leading to the government and unions considering restructuring
            the retirement framework legislature. One prominent problem is that majority of South African employees
            do not save enough for retirement. It is either that they do not save at all till late or that when they
            change employers they use their savings accumulated at that moment and have to start from scratch not
            considering the time factor. Unfortunately, time is an irreplaceable commodity that is often taken
            for granted. And also the irresistible drug-effect of immediate gratification. <br>
            <h2>How much is enough?</h2>
            This is a question that often cannot be given a simple answer. The obvious reason for this is the
            nature of planning for the future. It all would depend on your desired lifestyle, inflation,
            economic conditions of that time, your state of health etc. Of all these factors, you will
            only have some control over the lifestyle you would like to have at retirement and beyond.
            There are many online tools available to calculate how much monthly contribution to make
            if you know your retirement lump sum goal and the time you have before retirement.<br>
            Ideally you need to start early and contribute as much as you can. As you draw to about
            10 years before your age of retirement you should have an idea of your monthly expenses,
            and should be able to work out your lump sum goal. Work out if it is attainable and go for it.<br>
            <h2>What if your savings are not enough?</h2>
            It can and will happen for some that they realize that they have run out of time to reach
            any sustainable goal. What then?
            It would be an undesirable situation but certainly not the end of the world. Some options
            would be:<br>
            1. to considerably downscale your monthly commitments.<br>
            2. Consider remaining employed longer or finding a part-time job.<br>
            3. Move to a small town where cost of living is not as high or where you could grow your
            own vegetables or some livestock.<br>
            4. Start a small business.<br>
            There probably are more options, but you get the idea.
            I think of retirement as one of the periods in life that is supposed to be so fulfilling.
            With some skills, experience and control of your time back in your hands. But you need to
            plan and think ahead. Make choices that are informed and review them regularly. Be careful
            of running out of money and remember to always keep an updated will. You certainly could make
            use of some trustworthy professional advice.
