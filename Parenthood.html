                <p>Being a parent comes with lots of short and long-term financial responsibilities from diapers to
                    almost
                    15-years of education. Also continuous financial struggles usually result in a life-time impact onto
                    a
                    growing child. In-fact the way a parent or parents manage themselves and their finances plays more
                    than
                    50%
                    on how a child turns out to be in life.
                    So ideally deliberate planning needs to take place before any conception takes place. If we are to
                    build
                    better communities the fact remains that two heads, two incomes and some establishment would result
                    in a
                    better outcome for all involved than otherwise.
                    As parents we want to provide what we think is best for our kids but without compromising much on
                    your
                    plan
                    set out at Starting Out priorities need to change.</p><br>

                <h2>Risk Management</h2>
                <p>More than ever before now that you are a parent you need to consider
                    all
                    the
                    ‘what ifs’ of
                    all life. Best home, car, food and best education may be important for you to provide for your
                    child,
                    but
                    what if you were not to be around with all your love and income. What would then happen to these
                    children?
                    Who would provide for them? If for some tragedy both you and your spouse are not around, who
                    would
                    look
                    after your children and how would they decide how to go about that as closely as possible to how
                    you
                    would
                    have done?
                    This is where a will plays an important role. Two of the most important components of your
                    financial
                    plan as
                    a parent should be a life cover and a will.</p><br>

                <h2>Investing</h2>
                <p>You now need to manage lots of priorities in parallel without busting
                    your
                    budget. On top of your
                    retirement and other personal goals you also need to have a plan for your children’s education.
                    As
                    with
                    all
                    your earlier investments, the earlier you start, the better your chances are of achieving your
                    goals. If
                    you
                    started on time and a little more aggressively with your retirement, perhaps you could make use
                    of
                    the
                    power
                    of compound interest and time and ease off a little in order to concentrate more on the
                    education
                    plan
                    and
                    other family expenses. Most parents make the mistake of completely putting aside their
                    retirement
                    investment
                    for a time later on in life when their children would have finished school. This option actually
                    makes
                    you
                    miss out on the opportunity of compound interest.</p>
