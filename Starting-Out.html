                <p>Finally, after those many years of notes, tests and examinations
                    you have secured your first source of income. It is an exciting
                    time, or at least it was for me. It is super important that you start well.
                    The financial habits that you build now will either make you or break you.
                    But you have no reason to build bad financial habits now that you are here
                    and reading this. Have a plan for your entire life including a plan for your
                    finances, this should go without saying.</p>

                <h2>1. Budgeting</h2>
                <p>I have heard some people saying ‘don’t take yourself too seriously.’ Well, if
                    you want the above average kind of success, you have to be serious. You’ll notice that governments
                    and corporations have
                    budgets that get reviewed periodically, that’s how serious you ought to be. You need to be ware of
                    all the
                    money coming in. You also need to be aware when it leaves your bank account and wallet, decide in
                    advance and
                    know exactly how much is going where. Have a record of all this activity and review it
                    periodically to see if it is in keeping with your desired life’s direction. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-2">
                <h2>2. Saving</h2>
                <p>It comes natural to want to jump gears just because it kind of looks like you can.
                    But you should take your time to see what works and what does not without
                    adjusting your lifestyle drastically just because you just started earning an income.
                    You can buy yourself the necessary stuff but your priority should be paving your way
                    to financial wellness, not just for yourself only, but often than not, for others
                    around you as well. There is no better period than now to start building the disciple of saving.
                    First you need to aim to have a cash reserve that can carry you through for at least three
                    months without your income. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-3">
                <h2>3. Investing</h2>
                <p>The economic system is made up such that cash money on anyone’s hand loses its purchasing
                    power over time. The one way, if not the only, is not to keep cash but rather to buy
                    something that one can sell in the future. This is known as investing and should be
                    the next goal after one has built enough cash reserve. The sooner one can start, the
                    better the outcome is likely to be. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <h2>4. Risk Management</h2>
                <p> As much as we all would like the sky to be always blue and calm but every now and
                    then it is not so.
                    There are some sort of adverse events that can derail our plans which we call risks.
                    Risk involves loss of property (theft or accident), loss of income (illness or disability)
                    or loss of life (death). If you own a car, at this stage of life it is unlikely that you
                    would be in a position to be able to replace it if it gets stolen or damaged. The same
                    goes if you become disable or affected by some critical illness, etc. This is where
                    insurance plays a role in helping one to financially meet the demands of the situation. </p>

            <p>Your financial plan as someone starting out should involve these four factors.
                It may look simple or complicated but the trick is to commit. That is when
                you can really find out how simple or complicated it is. Remember to never
                be complacent, especially not at this stage, if ever. You need to be continuously
                challenged in order to grow. It is also a good idea to continue acquiring new
                skills so that you can climb up and stay relevant in your industry.</p>
